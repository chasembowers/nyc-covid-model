# nyc-covid-model
  Train/test a model of the COVID outbreak in New York City accounting for the PAUSE (lockdown). The model is fit to the publicly available death data using the Lancet's fatality rate, Governor Cuomo's current infection rate, and statistics from a bunch of other studies. The model predicts future deaths and the size of infected/contagious populations.
